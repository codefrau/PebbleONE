The ONE Pebble Watch Face
=========================

This is a highly readable analog watchface for the [Pebble Smartwatch][pebble], intended for every-day use.
Its features are customizable, but I want to keep the overall look simple.

This latest version is built on the [Pebble SDK 2.0][sdk2] and needs the Pebble 2.0 firmware to run.
You can install the app from [My Pebble Faces][download].

Contributions are highly welcome - just send me a [pull request][pullreq].
